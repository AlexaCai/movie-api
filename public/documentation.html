    <h1>Movie API</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This API is the server-side component of a movies web application. This web
        application provide users with access to information about different
        movies, directors, and genres by interacting with a database that stores data
        about different movies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application is hosted online. The web application itself is responsive an can therefore be
        used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever users of the web application are interacting with the application, the server-side of the
        application is used, processing their requests and performing operations against the
        data in the database. The users are able to use the the web application whenever they like
        to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their
        list of favorite movies.
    </p>
    <p>
        More specifically, the web application:
    <ul>
        <li>Returns a list of ALL movies to the user.</li>
        <li>Returns a list of ALL movies to the user.</li>
        <li>Returns data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it’s featured or not) about a single movie by
            title to the user.</li>
        <li>Returns data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”).</li>
        <li>Returns data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name.</li>
        <li>Allows new users to register.</li>
        <li>Allows users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth).</li>
        <li>Allows users to add a movie to their list of favorites.</li>
        <li>Allows users to remove a movie from their list of favorites.</li>
        <li>Allows existing users to deregister.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Technical aspects</h3>
    <p>The complete tech stack used for this movie web application is the MERN
        (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack.
    </p>
    More specifically:
    <ul>
        <li>The API is a Node.js and Express application.</li>
        <li>The API uses REST architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the data
            operations listed above</li>
        <li>The API uses at three middleware modules, such as the body-parser package for
            reading data from requests and morgan for logging.</li>
        <li>The API uses a “package.json” file.</li>
        <li>The database is built using MongoDB.</li>
        <li>The business logic is modeled with Mongoose.</li>
        <li>The API provides movie information in JSON format.</li>
        <li>The API includes user authentication and authorization code.</li>
        <li>The API includes data validation logic.</li>
        <li>The API meets data security regulations.</li>
        <li>The API source code is deployed to a publicly accessible on GitHub.</li>
        <li>The API is deployed to Heroku.</li>
    </ul>
